# Deforum Presets by Safety Marc

If you want to achieve extra smooth, less flickery Deforum animations, you've come to the right place. Here are all the presets I've created for the Deforum Studio. They can be used with the Deforum extension for Automatic 1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI or WebUI Forge, they donâ€™t not work with the notebook or comfy nodes. 

These presets have been made to work with sdxl, more specifically Protovision XL.  
You can download it [here](https://civitai.com/models/125703/protovision-xl-high-fidelity-3d-photorealism-anime-hyperrealism-no-refiner-needed). 

Feel free to try other sdxl models but for optimum performance I recommend Protovision XL. 

## Instructions for Use:
1. Download the presets above along with the Hybrid input videos linked below. The majority of presets will not work without them. (All presets named "Classic" do not use hybrid video inputs).
   
   Hybrid Videos: [download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18R7o8yu-buv-28H54kxJT9nKUAhk6dQW?usp=sharing).

2. To load a preset into Deforum, copy the file path of the preset saved to your drive and paste it into the "Settings File Path" box for Deforum, then click "Load All Settings".

3. Next, navigate to the "Init" tab and the "Video Init" tab. You'll see a file path to one of the Hybrid Video input files. 

  **You need to replace** `C:/Your/File/Path/Here/` with the path to the video files you saved on your computer, while keeping the video file name in place. 

    Example: `C:/Ai/Hybrid-Video/Kaleidoscope2-12fps.mp4`

4. It's a good idea to now save the preset with the new file path in place, so the next time you load up the preset, everything will be ready to run.

I've included all my 15s and 30s presets, but not all the presets were mine, so not all will be available right now. There are a few new "Classic 3D" presets included, which are different from the 3D preset in D-Studio but do the same thing.

## Please Note!
Attempting to change the settings can result in undesired effects, such as overbaking and saturation of your final video. Only attempt to adjust the presets if you are experienced with Deforum. Even then, you may find it hard to make changes, as these presets work in a narrow sweet spot.

If you have any questions, please raise an issue or start a discussion. I'll be making some tutorials and adding new presets over time.
